## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a Web & Mobile Developer passionate about creating digital solutions that solve real-life problems.  
My journey into tech started with curiosity, but quickly became a mission: **designing useful systems that improve everyday experiences**.

I enjoy transforming ideas into functional platforms — from academic systems to real-world business applications — while continuously learning and evolving.

Curious by nature, I explore new technologies, algorithms, and modern development practices to push my limits and build smarter products.

## 🚀 My Story

My path into programming began during high school, where I discovered **JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and algorithmic thinking**.  
What started as learning concepts soon turned into building real applications.

Step by step, I moved from small experiments to structured projects:

- Development of secure academic platforms
- Collaborative systems for students
- Dashboard-based management applications
- Mobile and web solutions designed for local businesses

Through projects and internships, I learned not only coding, but also **problem analysis, UI structure, and real-world system design**.

## 🧠 Today

Today, I focus on building scalable and practical solutions, especially projects that can grow into startups.

Some of the projects shaping my experience include:

- 📚 **Scholalink** — a collaborative academic platform
- 💊 **PharmaLocal** — a geolocation-based system to find available medicines nearby
- 🏫 Secure school management and forum systems
- 📱 Mobile applications for business management

I love working on dashboards, system architecture, and user-centered interfaces inspired by modern platforms.
